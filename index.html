                      <h2>Shirdi SaiBaba</h2>
                      <p>
                        Sai Baba of Shirdi, also known as Shirdi Sai Baba, was an Indian spiritual master who is regarded by his devotees as a saint, a fakir, a satguru and an incarnation (avatar) of Lord Shiva and Dattatreya. He is revered by both his Hindu and Muslim devotees during, as well as after his lifetime.

                        Saibaba is now revered as incarnation of Sri Dattatreya and considered as Saguna Brahma. He is attributed to be the creator, sustainer and destroyer of this universe by his devotees. He is decorated with jewels and all forms of Hindu vedic deities as he is believed by his followers to be the supreme God.[2][3]
                        
                        According to accounts from his life, he preached the importance of realization of the self and criticized love towards perishable things. His teachings concentrate on a moral code of love, forgiveness, helping others, charity, contentment, inner peace and devotion to the God and guru. He stressed the importance of surrender to the true Satguru, who, having trod the path to divine consciousness, will lead the disciple through the jungle of spiritual training.[4]
                        
                        Sai Baba also condemned distinction based on religion or caste. It remains unclear if he was a Muslim or a Hindu. This, however, was of no consequence to Sai Baba.[5] His teaching combined elements of Hinduism and Islam: he gave the Hindu name Dwarakamayi to the mosque in which he lived,[6] practised both Hindu and Muslim rituals, taught using words and figures that drew from both traditions and took samadhi in Shirdi. One of his well-known epigrams, Allah Malik (God is King) and Sabka Malik Ek (Everyone's Master is One), is associated with both Hinduism and Islam. He is also known to have said Look to me, and I shall look to you.[4]

                      <h2>Ramana Maharshi</h2>
                      <p>Ramana Maharshi /ˈrʌmənə ˈməhʌrʃi/ (30 December 1879 – 14 April 1950) was an Indian sage[1] and jivanmukta.[2] He was born as Venkataraman Iyer, but is most commonly known by the name Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi.[3][note 1]

                        He was born in what is now Tiruchuli, Tamil Nadu, India. In 1895, an attraction to the sacred hill Arunachala and the 63 Nayanars was aroused in him,[4] and in 1896, at the age of 16, he had a "death-experience" where he became aware of a "current" or "force" (avesam) which he recognised as his true "I" or "self",[web 1][5] and which he later identified with "the personal God, or Iswara",[web 1][note 2] that is, Shiva. This resulted in a state that he later described as "the state of mind of Iswara or the jnani".[web 1][note 3] Six weeks later he left his uncle's home in Madurai, and journeyed to the holy mountain Arunachala, in Tiruvannamalai, where he took on the role of a sannyasin (though not formally initiated), and remained for the rest of his life.
                        
                        He soon attracted devotees who regarded him as an avatar and came to him for darshan ("the sight of God"), and in later years an ashram grew up around him, where visitors received upadesa ("spiritual instruction")[7] by sitting silently in his company asking questions.[8] Since the 1930s his teachings have been popularized in the West, resulting in his worldwide recognition as an enlightened being.[9]
                        
                        Ramana Maharshi approved a number of path and practices,[3] but recommended self-enquiry as the principal means to remove ignorance and abide in Self-awareness,[web 2][10] together with bhakti (devotion) or surrender to the Self.

                      <h2>Poondi Swamy</h2>
                      <p>“Sri Poondi Swami was first seen around 1935 in a village called Kalasapakkam, about twenty miles from Tiruvannamalai in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. When he first revealed himself to public gaze, he had assumed the mien of a mad person. With his gait and well-built physique he appeared to the villagers to be a retired military man. He stayed first in the Kakkamgalai Pilliar temple and then in a dilapidated mosque by the side of the road. Later he stayed in the Draupadi temple and under trees by the roadside. He used to wear a long shirt like a garment reaching below his knees and would never remove it even when it became torn and bedraggled. If someone gave him another shirt, he would not remove the old shirt but wear the new one over the old. His shirt pockets would be filled to bursting with old, empty cigarette packets, cigarette stubs, and old scraps of paper which he had stuffed into them. He would never ask anyone for anything – even food or water. If anyone offered him food they would have to feed him as they would a child; he would never feed himself. If someone put a cigarette in his mouth and lit it, he would smoke. He never talked to anyone on his own. As he never bathed, his body would be dirty and his hair matted with grime. Flies would be swarming over him, attracted by the grime and dirt, but he would never bother about them. If he started to walk, he would keep walking for miles together without stopping to rest. If once he sat down, it would be days or weeks or maybe even months before an impulse made him start up again. Once he got up, he would move off and go where his fancy took him. Nobody could predict when he would sit still or move, or where he would be at any time. Nobody knew his antecedents, his parents, or where he came from. None knew his caste or creed or even his name. No one ever heard him take the name of God or speak of spiritual matters.

                        At first, the people of Kalasapakkam dismissed him as just another madman. It took a miracle to show them that he was not a madman but a great mahatma who had assumed the form of a madman for his own mysterious purposes. A river named the Cheyyar flows by the side of Kalasapakkam. It is a seasonal river which flows whenever it rains in the nearby hills, but remains dry the rest of the time. The Swami used to sit in the sand of the riverbed which was burning hot in the fierce heat of the Indian summer. It used to be very difficult to walk across the riverbed because the burning sand seared your feet like a coal fire. But the Swami used to sit on the sand with no covering whatsoever, as if he were lolling on a silken mattress under the cool light of the full moon.</p>

                  <h2>A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada</h2>
                  <p>Abhaya Caranaravinda Bhaktivedānta Svāmi (born Abhay Charan De; 1 September 1896 – 14 November 1977) was an Indian spiritual teacher and the founder-preceptor of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness[1] (ISKCON), commonly known as the "Hare Krishna Movement". Members of the ISKCON movement view Bhaktivedānta Swāmi as a representative and messenger of Krsna Caitanya.[2][3][4][5]

                    Born Abhay Charan De in Calcutta, he was educated at the Scottish Church College in Calcutta.[6] Before adopting the life of a novice renunciate (vanaprastha) in 1950,[7] he was married with children and owned a small pharmaceutical business.[8][9] In 1959 he took a vow of renunciation (sannyasa) and started writing commentaries on Vaishnava scriptures.[10] In his later years, as a traveling Vaishnava monk, he became an influential communicator of Gaudiya Vaishnava theology to India and specifically to the West through his leadership of ISKCON, founded in 1966.[11][12] As the founder of ISKCON, he "emerged as a major figure of the Western counterculture, initiating thousands of young Americans."[13] He received criticism from anti-cult groups, as well as a favorable welcome from religious scholars such as J. Stillson Judah, Harvey Cox, Larry Shinn and Thomas Hopkins, who praised Bhaktivedānta Swāmi's translations and defended the group against distorted media images and misinterpretations.[14] In respect to his achievements, religious leaders from other Gaudiya Vaishnava movements have also given him credit.[15]
                    
                    He has been described as a charismatic leader, in the sense used by sociologist Max Weber, as he was successful in acquiring followers in the United States, Europe, India and elsewhere.[16][17][18] His mission was to propagate, throughout the world, Gaudiya Vaishnavism, a school of Vaishnavite Hinduism that had been taught to him by his guru, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati.[11] After his death in 1977, ISKCON, the society he founded based on a type of Hindu Krishnaism using the Bhagavata Purana as a central scripture, continued to grow. In February 2014, ISKCON's news agency reported reaching a milestone of distributing over half a billion of his books since 1965. His translation of and commentary on the Bhagavad Gītā, titled Bhagavad-gītā As It Is, is considered by adherents of the ISKCON movement and many Vedic scholars as one of the finest literary works of Vaishnavism translated into the English Language.</p>
